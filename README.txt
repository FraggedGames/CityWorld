Park benches
Figure out why trees are missing from parks sometimes

v0.4 (preliminary)
Added cisterns and most of the tops of parks
Added the command "CityWorld", which will teleport you to (and create) "CityWorld"
Added stairs back in (they might be missing in some buildings but that is pretty rare)
Added doors (like stairs they might be missing in some buildings)
Manholes are more functional (ladders and doors are down there now)
Roundabouts now have fountains, "ART!" or a bit of both
Got BlockPopulators working
Cleaned up the code considerably

v0.3
Added sewers and plumbing
Added vaults
Added basements
Removed stairs (coming back in next release)

Better building layouts

v0.2
There is still much to do, but it is good beginning. We now have a little bit of color. There are basements and stairs but no doors... doh!. Still much to do... including: parks (real ones not the silly ones I have now), cisterns, neighborhoods, parking structures, sewers, farms and DOORS!
