== Commands

<<color red>>**Please note:**<</color>>
For the best experience with CityWorld, I **STRONGLY** recommend you use a multi-world manager plugin instead of using the following commands. 
There are a number of world creation/management gotchas that are not handled by CityWorld and that is what the various multi-world plugins are for. 
For more information about multi-world managers plugins: check out the [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cityworld/pages/installation-instructions/|installation notes.]]

----
If you just want to explore CityWorld and don't have a multi-world manager plugin installed then I have included a few commands for server operators.

To perform a command just type the letter **"T"** and enter the following...

##**/CityWorld** [Leave] [Normal | Nether | The_End] [Floating]##
If you leave out the ##Leave## you will be transported to CityWorld. 
Adding the ##Leave## will transport you to Minecraft/Bukkit's default world, which is normally the world called "world".

##**/CityChunk** [Regen] [Clean] [ChunkRadius]##
*##Regen## will force the chunk to regenerate. 
*##Clean## will remove any "floating" items. 
*Providing ##ChunkRadius## will cause the operation to effect not just the current chunk but surrounding ones as well, this is an integer. For example, specifying 3 as ##ChunkRadius## will perform the operation on an area of 7x7 chunks centered on your current chunk.

You can disable the commands via permissions. 
Remember they all default to ##op##, so if you want to play with the commands you will need to make sure you have added yourself to the ##ops.txt## file.
|=Permissions|=Description|=Default|
|cityworld.command|allows users to enter and leave the default CityWorld|op|
|cityworld.create|allows users to create the default CityWorld|op|
|citychunk.command|allows users to perform chunk maintenance|op|
