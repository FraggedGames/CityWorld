To perform a command just type the letter **"T"** and enter the following...
* ##/CityWorld [Leave]##
If you leave out the ##Leave## you will be transported to CityWorld. Adding the ##Leave## will transport you to Minecraft/Bukkit's default world.

* ##/CityChunk [Regen] [Clean] [ChunkRadius]##
**##Regen## will for the chunk to regenerate. 
**##Clean## will remove any "floating" items. 
**Providing ##ChunkRadius## will cause the operation to effect not just the current chunk but surrounding ones as well, this is an integer. For example, specifying 3 as ##ChunkRadius## will perform the operation on an area of 7x7 chunks centered on your current chunk.

You can disable the commands via permissions, both default to OP (so make yourself an Op to maximize the fun)
* cityworld.command
* citychunk.command
