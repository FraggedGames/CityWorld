== **CityWorld** ==
The great outdoors is all good and fine but sometimes you just want to go to town. Not any town will do, how about one that goes on forever or multiple ones separated by the largest mountains possible in Minecraft. But what is under those mountains? There is an entire world to explore, have fun!

v1.04
* Made the stairs in the mineshafts a little less rickety looking
* Added alcoves to the mineshafts to make the spawners and chests less obvious
* Removed the silverfish from the sewers and mineshafts... yike!, that was a bad idea!
* Oops, sometimes the vertical mineshafts go down beyond the bedrock... double yike!, that was even a worse idea!
* Fixed a buggaboo that made the bunkers plots clear out too much rock and not generate caves correctly
* Incorporated support for Tekkit material types base on initial work by gunre
* If options are used, I put in some sanity checks to make sure all the plots are actually filled with something

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new CityWorld (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. This is especially obvious if you are flying around. Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. What I recommend is take a tour of your world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.

=== Commands ===
To perform a command just type the letter **"T"** and enter the following...
* ##/CityWorld [Leave]##
If you leave out the ##Leave## you will be transported to CityWorld. Adding the ##Leave## will transport you to Minecraft/Bukkit's default world.

* ##/CityChunk [Regen] [Clean] [ChunkRadius]##
**##Regen## will for the chunk to regenerate. 
**##Clean## will remove any "floating" items. 
**Providing ##ChunkRadius## will cause the operation to effect not just the current chunk but surrounding ones as well, this is an integer. For example, specifying 3 as ##ChunkRadius## will perform the operation on an area of 7x7 chunks centered on your current chunk.

You can disable the commands via permissions, both default to OP (so make yourself an Op to maximize the fun)
* cityworld.command
* citychunk.command
