== **CityWorld** ==
The great outdoors is all good and fine but sometimes you just want to go to town. 
Not any town will do, how about one that goes on forever or multiple ones separated by the largest mountains possible in MineCraft. 
But what is under those mountains? 
There is an entire world to explore, have fun!

v2.01
* Added support for WorldEdit [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cityworld/pages/schematics/|schematics]].
If you want to use this feature, you will need to make sure you have WorldEdit 5.4.2 installed.
* Almost every file has changed, I am pretty sure some new bugs have been created while fixing 
other ones but I hope the features now out number the bugs
* Fixed a silly glitch that made CityWorld fail if WorldEdit wasn't installed. 
* Bukkit 1.3.2 happiness
* Added a ruined castle up in the mountains
* Added warehouses (double high single story buildings) in the industrial zone
* Added storage lots (like radio tower bases but with "stuff") in the industrial zone
* Still no procedural interiors, sorry but I think the schematics feature makes up for it for now :-)

** Personal note **

While I will attempt to fix any bugs that pop up in the schematics support, this will be the last major release for a while. 
My day job is finally ramping up and it will be keeping me very busy for the foreseeable future.

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. 
In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new CityWorld (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. 
This is especially obvious if you are flying around. 
Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. 
What I recommend is take a tour of your new world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.
