== **CityWorld** ==
The great outdoors is all good and fine but sometimes you just want to go to town. Not any town will do, how about one that goes on forever or multiple ones separated by the largest mountains possible in Minecraft. But what is under those mountains? There is an entire world to explore, have fun!

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. 
In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new CityWorld (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. 
This is especially obvious if you are flying around. 
Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. 
What I recommend is take a tour of your new world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.
