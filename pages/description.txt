== **CityWorld** ==
The great outdoors is all good and fine but sometimes you just want to go to town. Not any town will do, how about one that goes on forever or multiple ones separated by the largest mountains possible in Minecraft. But what is under those mountains? There is an entire world to explore, have fun!

v1.04
* Added World generated as [[http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/43/501/2012-07-22_22.37.39.jpg|Nether]] automagically makes everything destroyed
* Still working on TheEnd based worlds... it will be cool trust me :-)
* Added decayed options for buildings, roads and nature
* Fixed the crosswalks so they appear when they should
* Fixed the disappearing radio town shacks (still happens but rarer)
* Added streetnames... no it isn't customizable right now but might be soon
* Fixed the tree distribution, more randomness and trees
* Added city and road radius for folks who want a single city surrounded by nature
* Made the stairs in the mineshafts a little less rickety looking
* Added alcoves to the mineshafts to make the spawners and chests less obvious
* Removed the silverfish from the sewers and mineshafts... yike!, that was a bad idea!
* Oops, sometimes the vertical mineshafts go down beyond the bedrock... double yike!, that was even a worse idea!
* Fixed a buggaboo that made the bunkers plots clear out too much rock and not generate caves correctly
* Incorporated support for Tekkit material types base on initial work by gunre/adept
* If options are used, I put in some sanity checks to make sure all the plots are actually filled with something

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new CityWorld (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. This is especially obvious if you are flying around. Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. What I recommend is take a tour of your world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.
