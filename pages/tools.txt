This plugin keeps my code honest. 
The first time I used this it found so much stuff it took me a week to refactor everything. 
I learned a lot from what it found and the explanations it gave. Great Stuff Indeed!

While this is an odd name for a code profiler, it works great. 
In the past I found tools like this to be a pain to set up and get working with my code but this one worked first time out the door. 
Keep in mind that I am profiling a plugin (CityWorld) to a mod (Bukkit) to a server (MineCraft) while I played with a client (MineCraft). 
Crazy eh! They also support open source projects with free license. So cool!
