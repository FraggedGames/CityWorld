== Schematics

Schematics are an **advance** way to control what generates in worlds generated by CityWorld. 
Specifically they are prebuilt structures that CityWorld will use instead of its procedurally generated buildings.

Schematics are created via tools like...
* [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/worldedit/|WorldEdit]] (what we generally use)
* [[https://github.com/mcedit/mcedit#readme|MCEdit]]

When CityWorld needs to generate a new area it will look in a series of folders to find the schematics that make sense for the new area. 
The first folder that CityWorld looks for is the **Shape** of the world, currently that will either be **Normal** or **Floating**.
Within that folder CityWorld will look for a folder based on the **Style** of the world, this might be **Normal**, **Nether**, **Decayed**, etc.
Finally within that folder CityWorld will look for a folder that based on the type area being generated, some of these include **HighRise**, **Park**, **Farm**, **Neighborhood**, etc. 
Now that CityWorld has found the collection of schematics that will be used to augment the procedural based constructs, it loads/caches all of the schematics.
If the schematics hasn't been seen by CityWorld it will automatically generate a **YML** file for the schematic.
This **YML** file describes various options for the schematics. 
For example, you can tell CityWorld that it is ok to flip around the schematics when pasting it.
Also you can specify how far into the ground the schematics will "sink" into the ground (allowing you to create basements).
If you decide to play around with the **YML** file or add new schematics then you will need to delete and regenerate the world. 
This last step is unavoidable, sorry but this will is a side effect of **Random**.

//**I realize that this all sounds confusing but I did mention that this was an advance topic!**//

The good news all those crazy folders and YML files will be auto-generated when you generate your world (but only those needed for the world needs). 


FAQ
How big can my schematics be?
Right now the largest schematic supported by CityWorld is 64 by 64 blocks (4 by 4 chunks).
The height isn't limited per say but it does have to fit into the world so don't go too crazy.

I added new schematics, now strange things are happening.
Please delete your world's data files and allow it to regenerate.

I changed a YML on one of the schematics, now strange things are happening.

For the best experience with CityWorld, I **STRONGLY** recommend you use a multi-world manager plugin instead of using the following commands. 
There are a number of world creation/management gotchas that are not handled by CityWorld and that is what the various multi-world plugins are for. 
For more information about multi-world managers plugins: check out the [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/cityworld/pages/installation-instructions/|installation notes.]]

----
If you just want to explore CityWorld and don't have a multi-world manager plugin installed then I have included a few commands for server operators.

To perform a command just type the letter **"T"** and enter the following...

##**/CityWorld** [Leave] [Normal | Nether | The_End] [Floating]##
If you leave out the ##Leave## you will be transported to CityWorld. 
Adding the ##Leave## will transport you to Minecraft/Bukkit's default world, which is normally the world called "world".

##**/CityChunk** [Regen] [Clean] [ChunkRadius]##
*##Regen## will force the chunk to regenerate. 
*##Clean## will remove any "floating" items. 
*Providing ##ChunkRadius## will cause the operation to effect not just the current chunk but surrounding ones as well, this is an integer. For example, specifying 3 as ##ChunkRadius## will perform the operation on an area of 7x7 chunks centered on your current chunk.

You can disable the commands via permissions. 
Remember they all default to ##op##, so if you want to play with the commands you will need to make sure you have added yourself to the ##ops.txt## file.
|=Permissions|=Description|=Default|
|cityworld.command|allows users to enter and leave the default CityWorld|op|
|cityworld.create|allows users to create the default CityWorld|op|
|citychunk.command|allows users to perform chunk maintenance|op|
