== **CityWorld** ==
The great outdoors is all good and fine but sometimes you just want to go to town. Not any town will do, how about one that goes on forever or multiple ones separated by the largest mountains possible in Minecraft. But what is under those mountains? There is an entire world to explore, have fun!

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new CityWorld (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. This is especially obvious if you are flying around. Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. What I recommend is take a tour of your world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.

----
=== Installing ===

This is purely a world generator. If you need teleportation or world management support there are plenty of plugins that will do that for you. The Bukkit plugin ecosystem does not need more of those puppies. This is JUST A WORLD GENERATOR. :-)

To install it you will need to do three things...
# **Download the plugin and place it in Bukkit's plugin folder.** If you don't know where or what the Bukkit's plugin folder is, read [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]].
# **Now start up Minecraft Server via Bukkit.** If you don't know how to do this, I recommend rereading [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]].
# At this point, you may be asking yourself: **How do I get to the city?** 

There are two options for getting to the city...
* If you are the "OP" for your server: **Press "T", type in "/CityWorld" and press return (if you do this, remember that some plugins might not work with CityWorld until you modify bukkit's YML to include a reference to the world. For more info read [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Bukkit.yml|this]]).
* **OR... you can use a world management plugin and use the CityWorld as the generator for one of your worlds. We have used [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/multiverse-core/|Multiverse]] and [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/multiworld-v-2-0/|Multiworld]].

If you are still confused then rereread [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]]. :-)

=== Commands ===
To perform a command just type the letter **"T"** and enter the following...
* /CityWorld [Leave]
If you leave out the **Leave** you will be transported to CityWorld. Adding the **Leave** will transport you to Minecraft/Bukkit's default world.

* /CityChunk [Regen] [Clean] [ChunkRadius]
**Regen will for the chunk to regenerate. 
**Clean will remove any "floating" items. 
**Providing ChunkRadius will cause the operation to effect not just the current chunk but surrounding ones as well, this is an integer. For example, specifying 3 as **ChunkRadius** will perform the operation on an area of 7x7 chunks centered on your current chunk.

You can disable the commands via permissions, both default to OP (so make yourself an Op to maximize the fun)
* cityworld.command
* citychunk.command

=== Options ===
Config option file is now generated when CityWorld runs. These options only affect "new generation" and are not world specific (yet). Changing them after a world has been generated will produce some odd results. 

These all default to true and simply control the inclusion of a certain feature or not.
