== **CityWorld** ==
The great outdoors is all good and fine but sometimes you just want to go to town. Not any town will do, how about one that goes on forever. The Big Apple has nothing on this world generator. :-)

=== Heads up! ===

This plugin really "tests" MineCraft/Bukkit when it comes to complex worlds. In fact when you spawn/teleport into a new CityWorld (or some wildly new location) it takes a while for all of the blocks to generate. This is especially obvious if you are flying around. Once the blocks are generated though everything works just fine. What I recommend is take a tour of your world and just walk/fly up to each "uninitialized chunk" until everything shows up.

=== Installing ===

This is purely a world generator, it does not add permissions or options to configure. If you need permissions, teleportation or world management support there are plenty of plugins that will do that for you. The Bukkit plugin ecosystem does not need more of those puppies. This is JUST A WORLD GENERATOR. :-)

To install it you will need to do three things...
# **Download the plugin and place it in Bukkit's plugin folder.** If you don't know where or what the Bukkit's plugin folder is, read [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]].
# **Now start up Minecraft Server via Bukkit.** If you don't know how to do this, I recommend rereading [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]].

At this point, you may be asking yourself: **How do I get to the city?** 
There are two options...
# **Press "T", type in "/CityWorld" and press return
# **OR... you can use a multiverse plugin and use the CityWorld as the generator for one of your worlds. We use [[http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/multiverse-core/|Multiverse]].

If you are still confused then rereread [[http://wiki.bukkit.org/Setting_up_a_server|this]]. :-)
